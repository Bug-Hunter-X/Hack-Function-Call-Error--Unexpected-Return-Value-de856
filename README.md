This repository contains a simple Hack program that demonstrates an uncommon error related to function calls. The program has three functions: foo, bar, and baz.  The main function calls baz with an integer argument and then outputs the result. The issue arises from a subtle error in the way baz calls foo and bar, resulting in an unexpected return value.  The bug and its solution are provided in separate files.
